It is for this purpose that we target high potential Start-up and SMME’s, typically in labour intensive industries, wherein we add value in exchange for interest and influence proportional to our investment.

                        We invest in people, people who are not only very good at what they do, but as conscious and passionate about sustainable and socio-economical business practices as we are. It is through this philosophy that we believe that our impact will be far reaching. We will achieve this through a specific focus on providing support for any barriers of advancement typical in the start-up and SMME landscape.
